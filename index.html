    <h2>What is Creatine Monohydrate?</h2>
    <p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound in the body that helps produce energy during high-intensity exercise. Creatine Monohydrate is the most researched and effective form of creatine available. It helps replenish ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the body's primary energy carrier, enabling muscles to perform better during strenuous activity.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Creatine Monohydrate</h2>
    <p>The standard recommended dose for creatine is around 3-5 grams per day. Some users opt for a "loading phase," taking 20 grams per day for 5-7 days, followed by a maintenance phase of 3-5 grams per day. However, the maintenance dose is generally sufficient for long-term benefits, and a loading phase is not mandatory.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Pure Creatine Monohydrate?</h2>
    <p>When selecting a creatine supplement, purity matters. Pure Creatine Monohydrate contains no fillers or additives, ensuring you get the most effective and clean form of creatine. Look for a product that is micronized for better absorption and solubility.
